# postAAR

The goal is to develop an automated process to detect buildings within large sets of postholes in multi-occupational sites, similar to the obsolete Windows-software "posthole" (http://www.uni-koeln.de/~al001/posthole.html) by Irwin Scollar. We start off with the original fortran-code by Karel Segeth. The first idea is to write a wrapper for R, perhaps moving to Python (with a QGIS-Plugin as final solution) at a later stage.
